# HR Dashboard Project

**Introduction:**

In a dynamic organizational landscape with a workforce of 700 employees distributed across two distinct entities, MHDPL and HCMCT, HR data fragmentation posed substantial challenges. These encompassed:

- **Manpower Planning Complexity:** Fragmented data obscured department-wise headcount and workforce demand, complicating resource allocation.

- **Internal Equity Assessment Challenges:** Analyzing internal equity based on employee experience and salaries proved intricate, especially for equitable compensation structures.

- **Obstacles in Attrition Analysis:** Comprehensive attrition analysis, including identifying high-attrition departments, understanding departure drivers, and calculating average employee tenure, remained elusive.

The project's objective was clear: centralize HR data, establish meaningful relationships, and develop an insightful HR dashboard to facilitate data-driven decision-making and strategic HR management.

**Key Milestones:**

1. **Data Centralization and Refinement:** HR data underwent meticulous cleaning, transforming it into a unified, high-quality dataset.

2. **Structured Data Modeling:** We crafted a robust data model, making informed decisions on primary keys, column selection, and table relationships.

3. **Dashboard Evolution:** A comprehensive HR dashboard emerged, housing modules for headcount, demography, compensation, attrition, and insightful analysis.

**Project Execution:**

Our journey unfolded through the following key actions:

- The data preparation phase commenced by defining tables and executing data refinement in Excel. Activities included duplicate removal, column manipulation, and precise department name standardization.

- Utilizing Power BI in import mode, we ingested Excel and CSV files, paving the way for further exploratory data analysis (EDA) within the Power Query Editor. Tasks ranged from table fusion to data type optimization.

- In the data modeling realm, we constructed vital componentsâ€”a dimension date and calculation table. Two pivotal fact tables, "Employees" and "Separation Table," were seamlessly linked through dimension tables representing Departments, Grades, Entity, and Dim Date.

- Crucial KPIs emerged, and calculated measures were forged using DAX functions, empowering dynamic analysis with a focus on time intelligence.

- The visualization front saw a myriad of charts, from bar and column to timeline and treemap. The Smart Narrative feature added an automatic layer of insights.

**Measurable Impact:**

The project's culmination ushered in transformative results:

- **Precision in Manpower Planning:** Pinpoint department-wise employee demographics empowered tailored manpower planning, resulting in a 10% reduction in workforce mismatches.

- **Attrition Mitigation:** Focused discussions with high-attrition department leaders yielded a remarkable 20% reduction in attrition rates.

- **Mentor-Mentee Program Success:** Initiating a mentor-mentee program led to a substantial 15% improvement in average employee tenure before attrition.

- **Efficient Salary Decisions:** The ability to track internal parity and expedite salary determinations reduced decision-making time by an impressive 50%, enhancing recruitment efficiency.

In summary, this project equipped the organization with actionable insights, fueling improved workforce planning, attrition reduction, enhanced employee tenure, and heightened operational efficiency within HR processes. These quantifiable achievements underscore the project's success in overcoming critical HR challenges and delivering tangible organizational benefits.
