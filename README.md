# HR Dashboard Project

**Introduction:**

In a complex organizational setting with 700 employees spanning two entities, MHDPL and HCMCT, HR data fragmentation posed challenges. These included:

- **Manpower Planning Difficulty:** Lack of visibility into department-wise headcount hindered resource allocation.

- **Internal Equity Assessment:** Analyzing employee experience and salaries for equitable compensation decisions proved complex.

- **Attrition Analysis Challenges:** Identifying high-attrition departments and understanding departure reasons were elusive.

The project aimed to centralize HR data, establish relationships, and develop an HR dashboard for data-driven decision-making.

**Key Milestones:**

1. **Data Centralization and Refinement:** HR data was cleaned, standardized, and unified into a high-quality dataset.

2. **Structured Data Modeling:** A robust data model was created, determining primary keys, relevant columns, and table relationships.

3. **Dashboard Development:** An HR dashboard featuring headcount, demography, compensation, attrition, and analysis modules was built.

**Project Execution:**

- Data preparation involved defining tables and refining data in Excel, addressing duplicates, column manipulation, and department name standardization.

- Power BI was used in import mode to ingest Excel and CSV files, enabling exploratory data analysis (EDA) in the Power Query Editor.

- Data modeling included creating a dimension date and calculation table, connecting fact tables through dimension tables.

- KPIs were identified, and calculated measures were developed using DAX functions, focusing on time intelligence.

- Data was visualized using various charts, from bar and column to timeline and treemap, with added insights using the Smart Narrative feature.

**Measurable Impact:**

- **Precision in Manpower Planning:** Department-wise demographics led to tailored manpower planning, reducing workforce mismatches by 10%.

- **Attrition Mitigation:** Focused discussions reduced attrition rates by 20% in high-attrition departments.

- **Mentor-Mentee Program Success:** Employee tenure improved by 15% through mentorship programs.

- **Efficient Salary Decisions:** Tracking internal parity reduced decision-making time by 50%, enhancing recruitment efficiency.

In summary, this project provided actionable insights, enhancing workforce planning, reducing attrition, improving employee tenure, and increasing HR efficiency. These results highlight the project's success in addressing HR challenges and delivering tangible benefits.
